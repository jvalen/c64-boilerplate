# Boilerplate to kick start your C64 project

### Use

1. Intall [ACME](https://web.archive.org/web/20150520143433/https://www.esw-heim.tu-clausthal.de/~marco/smorbrod/acme/) cross assembler

2. Install a C64 emulator, [VICE](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/) works great!

3. Put the SID file inside ```/res``` and reference in ```src/load_res.asm```

4. Compile the program doing: ```$ acme main.asm```

5. Load the program in your emulator and have fun.
